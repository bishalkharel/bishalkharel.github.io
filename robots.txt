Good morning Mrs. Alexander,

My name is Bishal Kharal, a prospective student applying to Mississippi State University for fall 2023. I am planning to study computer science and mathematics and have been reviewing the college website for information on computer science offered at Howard University. I have some lingering questions about what type of research opportunities is offered to International freshman students.

Thank you in advance for your time. I appreciate your assistance.

Best, 
Bishal Kharal
